# Mouse Navigation extension for Visual Studio 2012+

[![Build status](https://ci.appveyor.com/api/projects/status/ydlc2uc5d9sxwwql/branch/master?svg=true)](https://ci.appveyor.com/project/sharwell/mousenavigation/branch/master)

This is an extremely simple and lightweight extension that adds support for using the back/forward buttons on the mouse for navigating back/forward in code. Pressing these buttons simply executes the Navigate Backward (default <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>-</kbd>) or Navigate Forward (default <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>Shift</kbd>+<kbd>-</kbd>) as appropriate.

If you encounter any cases where this extension does not behave the same way as pressing the navigation buttons in the toolbar, please let me know.

Thanks!
